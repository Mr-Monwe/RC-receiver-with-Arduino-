# RC-receiver-with-Arduino-
Controlling Arduino output with a hobby-grade RC remote.

Handy little code for configuring and testing a RC transmitter & reveiver.
There are two idividual files included in this repository, one is a scanner and the other is the main sample file.  
The Scanner can be used to extract pwm values from virtually any rc reciever.
The main file is used to drive two 24v motors by utilizing the Cytron MD10c motor driver. 

REMEBER TO CONFIGURE YOUR I/O PINS ACCORDING TO WHICH ARDUINO YOU ARE USING, ALL ARDUINOS ARE MADE DIFFERENTLY :)
